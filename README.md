# usePopcorn

usePopcorn is a user-friendly React-based application designed for movie and show enthusiasts. It allows users to effortlessly search for their favorite films and television series, providing detailed information such as ratings, descriptions, and genres. With a sleek interface and intuitive navigation, users can easily save their favorite titles to a personal list, making it simple to keep track of what to watch next. The application leverages various APIs to fetch real-time data, ensuring that users have access to the latest information about their favorite entertainment options.
This is a movie / series searching web App which displays all the details you are looking for including:

Movie Title
Poster Image
Release year
Cast
Director
Plot
Genre etc.
I have used advanced React.js concepts to build this.
It uses the useState and useEffect hook and react forms and controlled components.
The components are made from scratch including the starRating component.

You can also rate your favorite movie and add the movie to your own personalised list.
The data of the list will also be stored in your browser so it is a complete app.
